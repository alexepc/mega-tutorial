If you are a Python developer, and do not know of `Miguel Grinberg`, you are
way behind.

When I first encountered Flask_, I was just ending an exploration into Django_,
a popular Python web application framework. Django_ was a bit much. Flask_, on
the other hand, is a much lighter framework, and easier (at least for me) to
grasp. 

In searching for tutorials on using Flask_, I ran into Miguel's `Mega
Tutorial`_. It was complete, easy to follow, and helped me get a handle on
building Flask_ applications.

Miguel has just released version 2 of the `Mega Tutorial`, and you can buy a
PDF copy for a small fee. In order to support Miguel and his amazing work, I
bought a copy, and this repository is my attempt to follow along as I read the
new eBook.

Please go to Miguel's site to get more information on this effort. There is
nothing in this repo that is not better presented by the original author!
